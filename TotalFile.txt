Plagiarism is the representation of another author's language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions as one's own original work.[1][2]

Plagiarism is considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics. It is subject to sanctions such as penalties, suspension, expulsion from school[3] or work,[4] substantial fines[5][6] and even incarceration.[7][8] Recently, cases of "extreme plagiarism" have been identified in academia.[9] The modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal emerged in Europe in the 18th century, particularly with the Romantic movement.

Plagiarism is not in itself a crime, but like counterfeiting fraud can be punished in a court[10][11] for prejudices caused by copyright infringement,[12][13] violation of moral rights,[14] or torts. In academia and industry, it is a serious ethical offense.[15][16] Plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent, but they are not equivalent concepts,[17] and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright infringement, which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts.

Plagiarism might not be the same in all countries. Some countries like India and Poland consider plagiarism to be a crime, and there have been cases of people being imprisoned for plagiarizing.[18] In other instances plagiarism might be the complete opposite of "academic dishonesty," in fact some counties find the act of plagiarizing a professional's work flattering.[19] Students who move to the United States from countries where plagiarism is not frowned upon often find the transition difficult.[20]
